# Flight Route Planner

A comprehensive flight route planner application designed to help users find the best flight routes between cities. This tool uses Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate optimal paths and features a graphical user interface built with Java Swing.

---

## Features

- **Route Optimization:** Calculate the shortest path between two cities using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- **Graphical Interface:** User-friendly GUI developed with Java Swing.
- **Custom Input:** Users can input custom city data and routes.
- **Visualization:** Display routes and paths graphically.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **GUI Framework:** Java Swing
- **Algorithm:** Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path calculation,Tree data-structure for optimizing categories.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/onurguvensoy/Flight-Route-Planner.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

## Usage

1. **Add Cities and Routes:** Use the GUI to add cities and define routes between them.
2. **Find Routes:** Select a starting city and a destination city to calculate the shortest path.
3. **Visualize Paths:** View the calculated route and distance graphically.
